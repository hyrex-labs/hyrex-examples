# Project Notes: Deep Research Demo with Hyrex

## Implementation Log

### 2025-08-14: Initial Setup
- Created CLAUDE.md with project overview and development guidelines
- Created project-notes.md as append-only log for tracking changes
- Added reminder in CLAUDE.md to update this log with each codebase change
- Planning to build a deep research system using Hyrex for task orchestration

### 2025-08-14: Core Implementation
- Created requirements.txt with all dependencies
- Installed packages including FastAPI, Hyrex, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, ArXiv APIs
- Created search_providers.py with free search APIs (DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, ArXiv)
- Implemented tasks.py with Hyrex task definitions
- Learned correct Hyrex pattern: call .wait() then .result() to get task output
- Optimized workflow to maximize parallelization - launch all possible tasks before waiting
- Created FastAPI backend in app.py with research endpoints
- Built hyrex_app.py for Hyrex worker configuration
- Developed HTML frontend with beautiful gradient UI
- Added .env.example with Hyrex configuration options
- Created comprehensive .gitignore for Python/TypeScript projects
